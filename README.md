# responzer
Javascript to enable responsive features for iframes or other static content that cannot be easy changed.

## Why responzer?
There are a few scenarios where you are not able to use width values in percent, for example embedding a youtube video into your page or using a external Codeblocks which loaded async. In those cases responzer can be used as helper.

## Examples
Responzer is used in the most of my modules / projects. For example in my nx-youtubeBox.
